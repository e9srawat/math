# Project Euler Problem 49:
# Prime permutations
The arithmetic sequence, 1487, 4817, 8147, in which each of the terms increases by 3330, is unusual in two ways: (i) each of the three terms is prime, and (ii) each of the 4-digit numbers are permutations of one another.

There exist arithmetic sequences made up of three 1 to 4-digit primes, for which the terms are permutations of each other. What is the sum of the terms in the sequence?
