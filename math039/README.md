# Project Euler Problem 39:
# Integer right triangles
If p is the perimeter of a right angle triangle with integral length sides, {a,b,c}, there are exactly three solutions for p = 120:

{20,48,52}, 20 + 48 + 52 = 120
{24,45,51}, 24 + 45 + 51 = 120
{30,40,50}, 30 + 40 + 50 = 120
For which value of p â‰¤ 1000, is the number of solutions maximized?
