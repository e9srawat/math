# Problem 1

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

## Part A

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

Edit the file answer.py and update the function `answer` to return the answer.

```
answer()
```

## Part B

Write a function in python that returns the sum of all the multiples of a list of factors where the multiples are between the `start` and `end`, inclusive.

Edit the file solver.py to update the function `solver` which returns the answer when called as in the below example.

```
solver([3, 5, 12], 400, 1842)
```
