# Project Euler Problem 38:

# Pandigital multiples
Take the number 192 and multiply it by each of 1, 2, and 3:

192 × 1 = 192
192 × 2 = 384
192 × 3 = 576

By concatenating each product, we get the 1 to 9 pandigital, 192384576. We will call 192384576 the concatenated product of 192 and (1,2,3).

Find the largest 1 to 9 pandigital that can be formed by multiplying a given integer by (1, 2, ..., n) where n > 1.
