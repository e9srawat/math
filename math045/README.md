# Project Euler Problem 45:
# Triangular, pentagonal, and hexagonal
Triangle, pentagonal, and hexagonal numbers are generated by the following formulas:

Triangle: T_n = n(n+1)/2
Pentagonal: P_n = n(3n−1)/2
Hexagonal: H_n = n(2n−1)
It can be verified that T_285 = P_165 = H_143 = 40755.

Find the next triangle number that is also pentagonal and hexagonal.
