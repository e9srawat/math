# Project Euler Problem 37: Truncatable primes

The number 3797 has an interesting property. Being prime itself, it is possible to continuously remove digits from left to right, and each remaining number is still prime: 3797, 797, 97, and 7. Similarly, if we start with the rightmost digit and remove digits to the left, the resulting numbers are also prime: 3797, 379, 37, and 3.

Find the sum of all primes that are both left-truncatable and right-truncatable.

Note: For this problem, we shall consider 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7 as not being left-truncatable nor right-truncatable.

Please provide your solution in a language of your choice. Include a brief explanation of your approach, and make sure to avoid including any spoilers or explicit code snippets.
