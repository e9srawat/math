# Project Euler Problem 44:
# Pentagon numbers
Pentagonal numbers are generated by the formula, P_n=n(3n−1)/2. The first ten pentagonal numbers are:

1, 5, 12, 22, 35, 51, 70, 92, 117, 145, ...

It can be observed that P_4 + P_7 = 22 + 70 = 92 = P_8. However, their difference, 70 − 22 = 48, is not pentagonal.

Find the pair of pentagonal numbers, P_j and P_k, for which their sum and difference are pentagonal and D = |P_k − P_j| is minimized; what is the value of D?
